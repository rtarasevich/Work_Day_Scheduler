# Work Day Scheduler
### module 5 challenge for bootcamp

#### This is a simple scheduling app. Users can see on the app the current date and time and add something to their scheduling. It shows the time that has passed, the current time and future times.

This app is built using:
*   HTML/CSS

*   Javascript

*   Jquery

*   Bootstrap

*   Moment.js

I used javascript and jquery to write most of the html. I use bootstrap columns to create the structure. I used Moment.js to format that date and time.

Live app deployment can be found here:

I was given starter code that can be found here:
